<h3>About Presto-Build</h3>

<P><i>This project is just getting underway, so there isn’t much here yet. But if you’re interested in helping out, give me a shout.</i></P>

<blockquote class="notice">
<em><b>Presto</b> - Etymology: Italian, quick, quickly, from Latin </em>praestus<em> ready</em>; used to indicate the sudden appearance or occurrence of something often as if by magic. &mdash; <em><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/presto">Merriam-Webster</a></em>
</blockquote>

<P><em>Presto-Build</em> is a tool that is used to build other programs, akin to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>.  Much like Make, Presto-Build reads a <em>Makefile</em> that describes how to build your program, and how various pieces of your program are related.  From that description, Presto-Build will rebuild the target without requiring that the user know the precise details.</P>

<p>Presto-Build was born out of my frustration with trying to accomplish certain advanced tasks using Make.  Presto-Build is heavily inspired by Make.  I have always been very fond of the <em>simplicity</em> and <em>elegance</em> of its underlying design, and Presto-Build aims to preserve that elegance.  At the same time, I hope to offering a number of compelling features that would be difficult or impossible to achieve using Make.</P>

<p>Presto-Build is built directly on top of the <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua Programming Language</a>.  Like Make, Lua has a reputation for simplicity and elegance in its design&mdash;as well as its speed of execution!  All of Presto-Build's makefiles are actually Lua scripts, and the full power of Lua scripting is available when crafting your build system.</a>
